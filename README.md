# Issue Tracker
## Issues
- When adding dates, but not entering any data, this either results in no data being parsed or data entered further up being parsed again: This needs a fix. As long as all added dates are also filled in correctly, there is no issue

## To-Dos
- Create a button that calls deleteAllExpired
- Create a button per appointment that deletes the appointment
